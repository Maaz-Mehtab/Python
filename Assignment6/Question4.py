Define the following terms:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Attribute
4. Behavior

Class:
The class can be defined as a collection of objects.
It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods.
For example: if you have an employee class then it should contain an attribute
and method, i.e. an email id, name, age, salary, etc.

Object:
The object is an entity that has state and behavior. It may be any real-world object like the mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc.

Everything in Python is an object, and almost everything has attributes
and methods. All functions have a built-in attribute __doc__, which
returns the doc string defined in the function source code.

Attribute:
All classes create objects, and all objects contain characteristics
called attributes (referred to as properties in the opening paragraph).
 Use the __init__() method to initialize (e.g., specify) an objectâ€™s
initial attributes by giving them their default value (or state).
This method must have at least one argument as well as the self variable,
which refers to the object itself (e.g., Dog).

Behavior:
